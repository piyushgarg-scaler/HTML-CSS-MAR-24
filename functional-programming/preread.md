Title: Introduction to Functional Programming

Welcome to our upcoming class on Functional Programming. In this session, we'll delve into the fundamentals of functional programming paradigms, focusing on pure functions, higher-order functions, and built-in higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce. Here's a brief overview of what to expect:

1. **Functional Programming Basics:**

   - Definition and principles of functional programming.

2. **Pure Functions:**

   - Definition and characteristics of pure functions.
   - Statelessness and immutability.
   - Absence of side effects.
   - Benefits of pure functions in terms of predictability and testability.

3. **Higher-Order Functions (HOFs):**

   - Understanding functions as first-class citizens.
   - Definition and examples of higher-order functions.
   - Passing functions as arguments and returning functions as results.

4. **Built-in Higher-Order Functions:**
   - Introduction to map, filter, and reduce.
   - Understanding their purposes and use cases.
   - Examples illustrating their usage and benefits in simplifying code and enhancing readability.
   - Exploration of other commonly used higher-order functions (find some , every etc)

These are all the concepts we'll be covering in our class. We encourage you to review these topics and come prepared with any questions or thoughts you may have. We look forward to exploring Functional Programming with you in our upcoming session.

Happy Coding!
See you in the Class!
